Description:

    The data come from an experiment to determine the probability of rolling a six from non-cubic dice. 
    The dice have two faces of size 1 × 1 (both marked with a six) and four faces of 1 × r. That is, 
    the die is of size 1 × 1 × r, as in the image below.

    Various size dice were constructed from wood and rolled; the number of sixes observed were counted.

    There are 36 observations on four variables.

Variables:
    r 	The aspect ratio of the die, as explained in the Description above.
    Rolls 	The number of times each die was rolled.
    Sixes 	The number of sixes observed.
    Group 	The group doing the experiment; one of 1, 2, 3, A, D or S. Groups 1, 2 and 3 were school children; 
		Groups A, D and S were actually individuals in a Honours class

Data Quality:
    There are no missing values.

    The data are reported and used in:
    Dunn, Peter K. (2003). What happens when a 1×1×r die is rolled? The American Statistician, 57(4), 258–264.

    The data for Groups 1, 2 and 3 were collected by Year 11 and 12 school children at Maths Day 2002 in Toowoomba, Australia. The data for Groups A, D and S were collected by individual Honours students (A, D and S are the initials of their first names).
Notes:
    Thanks to Oliver Kinder for constructing the three sets of dice used for the experiment.
